# RSCook

The main idea of the web application is to develop a handy pocket app for finding recipes for your favorite dishes.

### Getting Started. Initialize the environment

1\. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RSCloneWars/RSCook.git
```
2\. Install the dependencies:
```

and follow the instructions.

### Launch the app

**Run the development server:**
```
npm run dev
```
and now you can see the live app at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

**Run the production build to see if this change affects the size:**
```
npm run build
```
